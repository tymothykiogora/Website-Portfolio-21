            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>As of February 2021, I've been a Finance student in Kenya at Strathmore University, currently working at KRA ,taking a 1-yr sabbatical to explore my other interests in the field of IT. <br>I am also an avid football fan supporting Chelsea Football Club in UK as well as play football as a goalkeeper for Membley Park Fc currently in Kiambu sub-county division.
            .Despite not knowing to swim, i would love to live next to the beach. I enjoy getting to learn new things and purposing to learn an instument as well as gaining programming skills by the end of the year.
