            <h3><u>ABOUT ME</u></h3>
        <p>As of February 2021, I've been a Finance student in Kenya at Strathmore University, currently working at KRA ,taking a 1-yr sabbatical to explore my other interests in the field of IT. <br>I am also an avid football fan supporting Chelsea Football Club in UK as well as play football as a goalkeeper for Membley Park Fc currently in Kiambu sub-county division.
            .Despite not knowing to swim, i would love to live next to the beach. I enjoy getting to learn new things and purposing to learn an instument as well as gaining programming skills by the end of the year.  
			I enjoy understanding how people think and why they behave the way they do and hence in my free time enjoy learning psychology and rationality to figure out how their thought trains. </p>
